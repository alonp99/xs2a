== Features description
=== Strong customer authentication
Some of the following transactions require strong customer authentication (SCA) of the PSU at the XS2A interface as part of the transaction:

* Payment initiation transactions.
* Cancellation initiation transactions (depending on the regulations for this kind of
  transactions at the user interfaces offered by the ASPSP to the PSU directly).
* Establish account information consent transactions.

=== Sca Approaches
XS2A Interface supports multiple SCA approaches. https://git.adorsys.de/adorsys/xs2a/aspsp-xs2a/blob/develop/aspsp-profile/README.md[ASPSP Profile] contains a list of approaches (in order of priority - first one with the highest priority).
Choice of SCA approaches depends on header parameter in payment, consent or signing basket initiation request - TPP-Redirect-Preferred. For Payment Cancellation parameter "TPP-Redirect-Preferred" is not used.
If TPP-Redirect-Preferred is true and ASPSP supports REDIRECT approach, then REDIRECT approach is used. Otherwise first approach in ASPSP-profile option scaApproaches is used.

===== SCA using the redirect approach
For the redirect approach the individual steps of the SCA are not executed at the XS2A interface, but directly between the PSU and the ASPSP. In this case, the PSU is redirected to a web interface of the ASPSP for authentication.
Once the PSU has been redirected to the ASPSP (app or web interface) the SCA of the PSU is executed step by step and directly between the ASPSP and the PSU. After completion of the SCA the PSU is redirected back to the TPP.

===== SCA using the integrated OAuth2 approach
The transaction flow of the OAuth2 approach to SCA is similar to that of the redirect approach. The difference is that the redirection to the authentication server of the ASPSP is embedded into the OAuth2 protocol, where the "scope" attribute of the OAuth authorisation request is linked to the created payment initiation or consent resource.

===== SCA using the embedded approach
When applying the embedded approach the SCA of the PSU is executed entirely as part of the transaction at the XS2A interface.

=== Explicit/Implicit start of authorisation
Explicit start of authorisation is supported in case of Multilevel SCA and in case of Signing Basket, otherwise there is implicit start of authorisation.


=== Payment Initiation Services
The support of this use case at the XS2A interface is mandatory.
Transactions according to this use case can be used to initiate a single payment in form of a credit transfer from an account of the PSU to an account of the payee.
While the transaction at the XS2A interface is initiated by the TPP, it must first be initiated by the PSU at the PSU – TPP interface.
The ASPSP will reject the transaction if the TPP cannot be identified correctly at the XS2A interface and/or if it does not have the role PISP. Subject to the decision of the ASPSP, strong customer authentication of the PSU has to be executed.

==== Payment Initiation Services in Embedded Approach

image::paymentInitEmbedded.png[Payment Initiation in Embedded Approach, title='Payment Initiation in Embedded Approach', align='center']

==== Payment statuses
Payment transaction status is synchronised in bank's database and in CMS. When payment data with payment transaction status is given from ASPSP, status will be updated, even if it is already finalised. There is endpoint in cms-aspsp-api to set payment data with payment transaction status directly from ASPSP to CMS.

Status settlement:

* Not confirmed with SCA payments obsolete after a certain period. Payment Transaction Status becomes "rejected" and Sca Status for dedicated payment authorisation becomes "failed".
* In case TPP tries to initiate new authorisation for expired payment, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 403 RESOURCE_EXPIRED.

The transaction status of the payment initiation resource which defines as *Finilised*:

* *Cancelled* (Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution).
* *Rejected* (Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected).
* *AcceptedSettlementCompleted* (indicating that the money has been booked already from the debtor account).

After setting finalised status for payment :

* status isn't allowed to be changed in CMS any more
* new authorisation sub-resource can't be created
* cancellation can't be proceed

==== Payment Cancellation
The support of this use case at the XS2A interface is optional.
A TPP may execute a transaction according to this use case to cancel a (still pending) payment, which has been initiated by him before. Only future dated payments and recurring payments may be cancelled by this use case.

NOTE: It is up to the ASPSP to decide if a given payment can still be cancelled or not.

Depending on SpiPaymentCancellationResponse properties *transactionStatus* and *cancellationAuthorisationMandated*:

* XS2A starts authorisation process of payment cancellation only for authorised payments (which were sent and accepted by ASPSP).
* When payment is finished (has transaction statuses Cancelled, Rejected, AcceptedSettlementCompleted) there isn't possibility to cancel it or to proceed payment cancellation authorisation flow. In this case XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 400 FORMAT_ERROR and output "Payment is finalised already and cannot be cancelled".
* If the payment is initiated and authorisation is not finished yet, then it is not yet sent to ASPSP and cancellation will be done without authorisation, even if ASPSP supports authorisation for cancellation of payment.

=== Account Information Services
==== Establish account information consent
The support of this use case at the XS2A interface is mandatory.
A TPP may execute transactions according to this use case to receive the right to execute further transactions according to the other use cases of the account information service. Subject to consent of the PSU, the TPP can obtain the following rights for transactions (of the account information service):

* Get the list of reachable accounts of the PSU once.
* Get the balances for a list of accounts once or multiple times.
* Get payment transaction information for a list of accounts once or multiple times.

XS2A performs validation of :

* TPP data from certificate in request is compared in CMS with TPP data in Consent:
* Account data should be asked by the same TPP which was given a Consent (TPP Reg_Num = tpp_id). In case when validation is unsuccessful, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 400 CONSENT_UNKNOWN.
* First check should be for consent access, and then for expiration.
* the consent is considered ready to be used by the TPP to access the AIS service when the status is VALID. A consent with RECEIVED status does not have an access token yet. If TPP wants to get account details, transaction and balance with consent which status is Received, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID.

==== Account Information Services in Embedded approach
image::ConsentInitEmbedded.png[Consent Initiation in Embedded Approach, title='Consent Initiation in Embedded Approach', align='center']

==== Consent Models
The XS2A supports three different consent models:

====== Consent on Dedicated Accounts:
Creates an account information consent resource at the ASPSP regarding access to accounts specified in this request.

* All permitted "access" attributes ("accounts", "balances" and "transactions") used in this message shall carry a non-empty array of account references, indicating the accounts where the type of access is requested.

* POST requests with the above mentioned sub-attributes, where at least one sub-attribute is contained, and where all contained sub-attributes carry a non-empty array of account references. This results in a consent on dedicated accounts.
+
NOTE: that a "transactions" or "balances" access right also gives access to the generic /accounts endpoints, i.e. is implicitly supporting also the "accounts" access.
+
It affects on response body for all account endpoints:

** Get consent request
** Read account list
** Read account details
** Read balance
** Read transaction list
** Read transaction details
+
* When this Consent Request is a request where the “recurringIndicator” equals true, and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on account information for the addressed PSU and potentially addressed corporate identification submitted by this TPP, then the former consent automatically expires as soon as the new consent request is authorised by the PSU.
There are no expiration side effects foreseen for Consent Requests where the “recurringIndicator” equals false (Clarification is contained here - V1_3Errata 20190214).
* When this Consent Request is a request for one access to the account data then "recurringIndicator" equals false and "frequencyPerDay" should not be more than "1".

===== Consent on Account List of Available Accounts
This function implies a consent resource at the ASPSP to return a list of all available accounts, resp. all available accounts with its balances.

The ability to create Consent on Account List of Available Accounts depends on successful validation:

* The attribute in ASPSPS Profile "availableAccountsConsentSupported" should be set to "TRUE".
* The call only contains the "availableAccounts" or “availableAccountsWithBalances” sub attribute within the "access" attribute with value "allAccounts".

* It should be ignored all possible content of "accounts", "balances", "transactions" fields.
* Applying one or two-factor authorisation depends on the value  of the parameter in ASPSP profile "scaByOneTimeAvailableAccountsConsentRequired" (true (by default), false)

===== Bank Offered Consent

This function implies a consent without indication of Accounts. The ASPSP will then agree bilaterally directly with the PSU on which accounts the requested access consent should be supported.
The ability to create Bank Offered Consent depends on successful validation:

* The attribute in ASPSPS Profile "bankOfferedConsentSupport" should be set to "TRUE",
* The call contains the "accounts", "balances" and/or "transactions" sub attribute within the "access" attribute all with an empty array.
* For this function the Embedded SCA Approach is not supported.

===== Global Consent
This function implies a consent on all available accounts of the PSU on all PSD2 related account information services.

The ability to create Global Consent depends on successful validation:

* The attribute in ASPSPS Profile "allPsd2Support" should be set to "TRUE".
* The call contains the "allPsd2" sub attribute within the "access" attribute with the value "allAccounts".
* It should be ignored all possible content of "accounts», "balances', "transactions", "allAvailableAccounts" and "availableAccounts WithBalance" fields (option «allPsd2» has the highest priority)
* Applying one or two-factor authorisation depends on the value  of the parameter in ASPSP profile "scaByOneTimeGlobalConsentRequired" (true (by default), false)

==== Consent expiration date
All requests to the CMS concerning any consentID should be validated for parameter "validUntil" (mandatory field). The parameter "validUntil" is adjusted for Consent in CMS according to parameter in ASPSP Profile "consentLifetime":

* if parameter "consentLifetime" = 0 or empty, then the maximum lifetime of Consent is infinity. Therefore no adjustment should be applied. 
* if parameter "consentLifetime" > 0, then the limit of a maximum lifetime of Consent is set in days and “ValidUntil” should be adjusted and stored in CMS with new value. For example, date of Consent request is 2019-03-01, “ValidUntil” is “9999-12-31" and "consentLifetime"=10, then adjusted value of “ValidUntil” should be 2019-03-10. And TPP will get new adjusted value by Get consent request.
* if parameter "consentLifetime" > 0 and “ValidUntil” contains date far than it is allowed by bank, then there should be adjustment to the date according "consentLifetime". For example, date of Consent request creation is 2019-03-01, “ValidUntil” is “2019-04-20" and "consentLifetime"=10, then adjusted value of “ValidUntil” should be 2019-03-10. And TPP will get new adjusted value by Get consent request;
* if parameter "consentLifetime" > 0 and “ValidUntil” contains date less than it could be allowed by bank, then no adjustment should be applied. For example, date of Consent request creation is 2019-03-01, “ValidUntil” is “2019-03-10" and "consentLifetime"=15, then adjusted value of “ValidUntil” should be 2019-03-10. And TPP will get "ValidUntil” =2019-03-10 by Get consent request;
* If the date of "validUntil" is in the past, then XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_EXPIRED.
* In case TPP tries to initiate new authorisation for expired consent, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 403 CONSENT_EXPIRED.

==== Counting of frequencyPerDay
This attribeute indicates the requested maximum frequency for an access without PSU involvement per day. For a one-off access, this attribute is set to "1"."


Number of TPP accesses is counted by every endpoint:

* fsd
* /accounts
* /accounts/account-id per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/transactions per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/balances per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/transactions/transaction-id per account-id and transaction-id, if applicable.

If the amount of accesses for any of these endpoints is exceeded - HTTP error 429 ACCESS_EXCEEDED is returned. All other endpoints are still accessible until their amount is not exceeded.

====== Frequency is addressing only the Read Account Data Requests without PSU involvement:

* When any GET Account Data Requests contain filled parameter PSU-IP-Address, then frequencyPerDay shouldn't be counted for this request with recurring consent.
* For one-off consent PSU-IP-Address should be ignored and frequencyPerDay should be counted.

==== Consent statuses
The status of the consent (the data element "consentStatus")resource is changing during the initiation process. In difference to the payment initiation process, there are only SCA checks on the consent resource and no feedback loop with the ASPSP backend.

Status settlement:

* While creating consent, In case of existing old unauthorised  recurring consent (status "received") for one TPP and one PSU - its consent status becomes "rejected",  as soon as new recurring one becomes authorised (consent status set to VALID).
* While creating consent, In case of existing old recurring authorised consent for one TPP and one PSU - its consent status becomes "Terminated_by_TPP" as soon as new recurring consent becomes authorised (consent status set to VALID).
* Consent without successful authorisation expire after a certain period. Consent Status becomes "rejected" and Sca Status for consent authorisation becomes "failed".

Statuses which defines as *Finilised*:

* *Rejected* (The consent data have been rejected e.g. since no successful authorisation has taken place)
* *RevokedByPSU* (The consent has been revoked by the PSU)
* *Expired* (The consent has been expired (e.g. after 90 days)
* *TerminatedByTpp* (The corresponding TPP has terminated the consent by applying the DELETE method to the consent resource)

After setting finalised status for consent:

* status isn't allowed to be changed in CMS any more.
* new authorisation sub-resource can't be created

=== Validation and Usage of Read Account Data Requests
For all Read Account Data Requests:

* ReadAccountList
* ReadAccountDetails
* Read Balance
* Read Transaction List

the *PSU-IP-Address added to the request header* definitions with the Condition "Conditional" and the following description to identify PSU involvement: "The forwarded IP Address header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request IP Address field between PSU and TPP. It shall be contained if and only if this request was actively initiated by the PSU."

All Read Account Data Requests contain consentID of Consent which was given to TPP by PSU earlier.

*XS2A performs validation of*:

* TPP data from certificate in request is compared in CMS with TPP data in Consent:
* Account data should be asked by the same TPP which was given a Consent (TPP Reg_Num = tpp_id). In case when validation is unsuccessful, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 400 CONSENT_UNKNOWN.
* First check should be for consent access, and then for expiration.
* The consent is considered ready to be used by the TPP to access the AIS service when the status is VALID. A consent with RECEIVED status does not have an access token yet. If TPP wants to get account details, transaction and balance with consent which status is Received, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID.
* First check should be for consent access, and then for expiration.

==== Granted Permission in appropriate Consent:
* For Get accounts with balances (query parameter *withBalance = true* ) validate if permission exists in the Consent.  In case when validation is unsuccessful, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID and output "The consent was created by this TPP but is not valid for the addressed service/resource".
* According to Specification 1.3: To have possibility to get balances or transactions or account data, TPP needs to know account-id - this identification is denoting the addressed account. The account-id is retrieved by using a “Read Account List” call. The account-id is the “resourceId” attribute of the account structure. Its value is constant at least throughout the lifecycle of a given consent. So after consent is expired - ASPSP may change account-ids and after establishing new consent TPP will need a new call to get account-ids.
* If Get account request has *"withBalance=true"* query parameter and Consent permission is valid - response should contain array of balances for account which was granted consent for balances. And it doesn't influence on links.
* If Get account request has *"withBalance=false"* query parameter - response should not contain array of balances. And it doesn't influence on links.
* In case of access not granted for balances or transactions, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID.
* Links balances and transactions should appear in Get Account response according to Consent access :

=== Support of Relative and Global links in responses
In xref:aspsp-profile/README.md[ASPSP Profile] support of relative links should look like:
```
forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl: true
xs2aBaseLinksUrl: "/"
```
- If `forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl` is set to `true`, links in responses (except "scaRedirect") shall be generated with the base URL set by `xs2aBaseLinksUrl`:

1. xs2aBaseLinksUrl="/" - for relative link;
2. xs2aBaseLinksUrl="`http://myhost.com/`" - for global link;

- If `forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl` is set to `false`, links in responses (except "scaRedirect") shall be generated with the base URL of controller (as it is now)

- Default value for `forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl` is `false`
