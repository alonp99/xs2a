== Bugfix: Update PSU Data (Select Authentication Method) for account information consent request fails with an error
Executing valid Update PSU Data (Select Authentication Method) for account information consent request
 (`PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`) with non-json body will no longer result in
 `400 FORMAT_ERROR` being returned in the response.

== Bugfix: Increase the length of the `iban` and `end_to_end_identification` columns in the database

Types of the `iban` and `end_to_end_identification` columns were changed to increase the value length limit.
The type of the `iban` column in the `account_reference` table was changed to `VARCHAR(34)` and the type of the
`end_to_end_identification` column in the `pis_payment_data` table was changed to the `VARCHAR(35)`.
