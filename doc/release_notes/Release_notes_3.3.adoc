== Deleted deprecated method createConsent in CmsAspspPiisService

Method `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.aspsp.api.piis.CmsAspspPiisService#createConsent(PsuIdData, TppInfo, List, LocalDate, int)` was removed,
use `CmsAspspPiisService#createConsent(PsuIdData, CreatePiisConsentRequest)` instead.

== New mechanism for counting frequencyPerDay

From now on, we count the number of consent usages by every endpoint:

* /accounts
* /accounts/account-id per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/transactions per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/balances per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/transactions/transaction-id per account-id and transaction-id, if applicable.

If the amount of accesses for any of these endpoint is exceeded - the `429 ACCESS_EXCEEDED` is returned. All other
endpoints are still accessible until their amount is not exceeded.

Also, the `usageCounter` field in `AisAccountConsent` is deprecated - now the new field `usageCounterMap` should be used
instead. It is a map: key is the endpoint, value is a number of its usage. The following services were affected by this
change:

  * In consent-aspsp-api:
     `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.aspsp.api.ais.CmsAspspAisExportService`
    (`GET /aspsp-api/v1/ais/consents/tpp/{tpp-id}`, `GET /aspsp-api/v1/ais/consents/psu`, `GET /aspsp-api/v1/ais/consents/account/{account-id}`)
  * In consent-psu-api:
     `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.psu.api.CmsPsuAisService`
    (`GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/{consent-id}`, `GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/consents`)

== Bugfix: Wrong error code "requestedExecutionDate" value in the past

Error code was changed to `400 EXECUTION_DATE_INVALID` from `400 FORMAT_ERROR` when `requestedExecutionDate` field is less then current date.

== Bugfix: Resolve SCA approach for the authorisation only once instead of separate resolving

From now on, SCA approach is resolved (using setting in ASPSP profile and request headers) only once per one authorisation.
All consecutive requests for updating PSU Data for the authorisation will use SCA approach from the authorisation instead
of resolving it separately.

This fixes the bug that prevented PSU Data from being correctly updated if the authorisation was created with
`Tpp-Redirect-Preferred` header set to `false` while the `Redirect` SCA approach has the highest priority in the ASPSP profile.

== Bugfix: Update PSU Data request for payment cancellation uses wrong SPI interface for authorising PSU

From now on, XS2A will no longer try to execute `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.service.PaymentAuthorisationSpi#authorisePsu`
instead of `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.service.PaymentCancellationSpi#authorisePsu` on Update PSU Data (Authentication)
request in context of payment cancellation (`PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/cancellation- authorisations/{cancellationId}`)
in `Embedded` or `Decoupled` SCA approach.

== Bugfix: Get account list with balances returns no balances first time

From now on, response to Get account list request with balances(`GET /v1/accounts?withBalance=true`) will
contain balances section and links right away instead of containing them only on the second request to this endpoint.
