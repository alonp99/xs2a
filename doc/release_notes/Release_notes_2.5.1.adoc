== Bugfix: Payment initiation request fails for non-json payment products

Executing valid initiate payment request (`POST /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}`) with non-json body will no 
longer result in `400 FORMAT_ERROR` being returned in the response. 

== Bugfix: Missing links in response to update PSU Data for account information consent request

From now on, response to the update PSU Data for account information consent request
(`PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorsationId}`) will contain proper links instead of only `self` and `status` links.
