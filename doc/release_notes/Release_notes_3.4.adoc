== Update version of spring-data-jpa to 2.1.8.RELEASE

Fixed potential security vulnerability in a repository that have been granted security alert access.
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3797[Additional information exposure with Spring Data JPA derived queries]

== Bugfix: `transactionFeeIndicator` tag is provided in payment initiation request even if it is not supported by Bank

The tag will not be returned in payment initiation response if it is not supported by Bank.
From now field SpiPaymentInitiationResponse.spiTransactionFeeIndicator has type Boolean (previous type was boolean).

== Bugfix: Incorrect property name in the response to the AIS consent creation request

From now on, the endpoint for consent creation (POST `/v1/consents`) returns correct response with field `psuMessage` instead of `message`.
`SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse` was extended to contain `psuMessage`.

== Bugfix: Periodic payment: requestedExecutionTime and requestedExecutionDate properties are set to the default values by mappers

- Payment object has to set these fields to null if they are not present in the initial request
- PisExecutionRule.PRECEEDING was renamed to PisExecutionRule.PRECEDING

== Removed deprecated getters in SpiExchangeRate class

Please use `getExchangeRate` instead of `getRate`, `getQuotationDate` instead of `getRateDate` and `getContractIdentification`
instead of `getRateContract`.

== Bugfix: Delete a non-existing consent returns wrong http status code

From now on, the response is `403 CONSENT_UNKNOWN` on request ("Delete an Account Information Consent Object" DELETE `/v1/consents/{consentId}`) when consent was not found.

== Counting frequencyPerDay only for one-off consent or for recurring consent without PSU IP address

From now on, we don't count the number of consent usages for recurring consent if the `PSU-IP-Address` header is present in the request.

== PSU-IP-Address header is mandatory in AIS consent creation request

From now on, TPP must provide `PSU-IP-Address` header in AIS consent creation request.

== Bugifx: XS2A returns error on creating authorisation if the request URL contains context path

From now on, XS2A will correctly handle non-default context path in the URL and won't fail with an error on creating
authorisation.

== Bugfix: AIS consent can be created with invalid `access` tag

From now on, attempting to create AIS consent (`POST /v1/consents`) with invalid values for `allPsd2` or
`availableAccounts` properties in `access` property will result in `400 FORMAT_ERROR` being returned in the response.

== Bugfix: Error "NO_PIIS_ACTIVATION" during Funds-Confirmations request was fixed
Fixed the process of finding PIIS consents during Funds-Confirmations request (`POST /v1/funds-confirmations`), which caused `NO_PIIS_ACTIVATION` error to be returned in the response.
This bug appeared only if ASPSP supported PIIS consent(`piisConsentSupported` property set to true in the profile).

== Bugfix: Encryption performance doesn't correspond requirements

Cryptography algorithms were adjusted in order to increase performance.
