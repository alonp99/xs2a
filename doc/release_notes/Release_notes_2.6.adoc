= Release notes v.2.6

== Bugfix: `transactionFeeIndicator` tag is provided in payment initiation request even if it is not supported by Bank

The tag will not be returned in payment initiation response if it is not supported by Bank.

From now on, attempting to create AIS consent (`POST /v1/consents`) with invalid values for `allPsd2` or
`availableAccounts` properties in `access` property will result in `400 FORMAT_ERROR` being returned in the response.
